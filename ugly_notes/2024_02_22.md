# Linear regression (Part 1)

## Overview of supervised learning 

### What kind of problem are we trying to solve ?
We're trying to find/approximate a funcition $f$, which is "generating" our dataset $D$.
The steps are:
- Define a loss function $L$
- Choose the hypothesis space $\mathcal{H}$
- Find in $\mathcal{H}$ an approximation $h$ of $f$ that minimizes $L$.
 
We might be tempted to enlarge the hypothesis space, but if we do that we can have a larger risk of approximating $f$ very poorly as we don't know if we'd be expanding $\mathcal{H}$ in the correct direction.

### The elements of a supervised learning algorithim
- The representation meaning the hypothesis space $\mathcal{H}$ and how it's designed.
- The evaluation, so how the loss function is designed.
- The optimization algorithim, how you're looking for candidate soltutions.

Some examples of representations are:
- Linear models.  
- Neural networks. 

Evaluation: 
- Accuracy, the % of time you're correctly classifying a datapoint.
- If you have a regression problem you could use MSE.

Finally, the optimization technique really depends on your loss function:
- Gradient descent.
- Greedy search.
- Linear programming (in cases where you have some sort of constraint)

## A supervised learning taxonomy
There are many ways you can try to classify/organize/compare, some more general paradigms other than the previous three.
### Parametric vs Non-parametric

There are some learning algorithims for which the deisgn of the hypothesis space is such that when you decide to apply a learning algorithim to a problem you have to define a set of parameters that are fixed and won't change with the data these are called **Parametric**, while non parametric models scale the number of parameters with the training set.

### Frequentist vs Bayesian

No meaningful definition given by the prof here.

### Direct, discriminative or generative

They're different ways to see the same problem from different perspectives, in the **direct** approach you don't really care about the probabilstic interpretation, you're just optinmizing the loss function. In the **discriminative** you interpret your problem as a conditional density $p(t|x)$ you essentially try to learn the distribution and then compute the expected mean. In the **generative**  tries to model the *joint* density $p(x,t)$, this allows to then infer the conditional density and generate novel samples by computing the conditional mean.
